# Prompt History Record: Agentic Chat System Implementation Plan

## PROMPT_TEXT
Based on the specification in specs/001-agentic-chat-system/spec.md, create a comprehensive implementation plan in plan.md that outlines the architecture, components, and implementation approach for the Agentic Chat System. Include technical architecture, component designs, API specifications, data models, and implementation phases.

## RESPONSE_TEXT
Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the Agentic Chat System that includes:
- Scope and dependencies
- Key decisions and rationale
- Interfaces and API contracts
- Non-functional requirements
- Data management and migration
- Operational readiness
- Risk analysis and mitigation
- Component designs
- Implementation phases
- Evaluation and validation criteria

The plan follows the Spec-Kit format and addresses all architectural aspects of the agentic chat system integrating ChatKit, OpenAI Agents SDK, MCP, and PostgreSQL.

## OUTCOME
Successfully created a detailed implementation plan document that outlines the complete architecture and approach for implementing the Agentic Chat System. The plan covers all required aspects including technical architecture, component designs, API specifications, data models, and implementation phases as requested.
